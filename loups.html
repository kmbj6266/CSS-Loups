			<p>My last posts depend on each other, and should be read in sequence. Articles not in bold are optional.</p>
				<br>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="special2">Assignment Statement Consicered Harmful.</span> Pervasive mutable state make programs more difficult to deal with. While this is old news, most programmers don't know or don't care. It's a pitty, because <span class="special2">simple remedies</span> exist.</li>
				
				<li><span class="special2">Defining Syntactic Sugar.</span> I sometimes hear arguments about what is or is not syntactic sugar. This is an attempt at defining it.</li>
				
				<li><span class="special2">Class-based Programming as Syntactic Sugar.</span> Most of the time, "Object Oriented" actually meanss classes. Classes are nothing more than systactic sugar, at least in statically typed languages such as Java and C++. Sugar is not useless, but seeing past it helps us understand classes better.</li>
				
				<li><span class="special2">Toboo "OO".</span> The term "OO" is so overloaded that we should stop using it. Better substitutes are "classes" and "prototypes".</li>
				
				<li><span class="special2">How Class based Programming Sucks.</span> Classes are vastly sub-optimal. Functional programming is far better.</li>
